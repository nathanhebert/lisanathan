## Are Nathan and Lisa feeding me?
YES! Food, drinks. Yes, yes, yes.   
**Note:** *Nathan and Lisa have arranged to provide you with plenty to eat and, well, more than plenty to drink. However, barring outstanding circumstances, they are relying on your unique and special ability to bring this bounty from the tables to your mouth. Plates and utensils are also provided.*

## Can I bring a friend?
Of course! Just send back the RSVP response that came with your invitation and let us know how many.

## What if I want to party late?
The Colony is rented through the night. Don't worry about it!

## What if I want to party reaalllyy late?
Didn't we say 'Don't worry about it?' The Colony is rented until noon the next day. **Nobody** is shutting this party down prematurely! Bring a sleeping bag if you like. Really.
