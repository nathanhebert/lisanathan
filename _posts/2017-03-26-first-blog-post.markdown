Hi friends and loved ones. Just pushing up a first post for the blog on Lisa and my shared website.

This page is currently in full-out wedding details mode, but may get used later for sharing little tidbits of our exploits in the coming years.

Being after 10 PM, Lisa is currently riding ponies in dream-land, so I'll leave this post brief.

I've been using the static website generator [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) to put together this website. The website structure and CSS was adapted from [https://github.com/taniarascia/startjekyll](https://github.com/taniarascia/startjekyll). It will be in a state of change for a little while.

The generated page is hosted on AWS using an economical static website stack. (The company store effect is, indeed, real.)

Upcoming changes - push local git repo to github for safe versioning; create bio pages for Lisa and me; proofreading; more fleshed out weddind details; more pictures; oxford commas.

üòç Nathan
