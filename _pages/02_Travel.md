## Where to stay
The wedding itself is located in the St. Johns neighborhood in North Portland. This area is a little bit outside the main part of the city, but does have its share of things to see and do. However, one could stay in any of the other wonderful neighborhoods Portland has to offer and not have to worry about having to travel too far to get back and forth from the venue. Taxis, public transportation, and Uber/Lyft are all available to take you to and from anywhere in Portland at a reasonable cost, so don't feel like you need to get lodging just in the St. Johns area!

The majority of hotels in town are in downtown Portland or by the airport. There is plenty to see and do downtown, as well as easy access to public transportation. There is *not* plenty to do by the airport except rent hotel rooms.

The east-side of Portland (where Nathan and I live!) has many wonderful neighborhoods with lots to do. There are many Airbnb options here, as well as a few hotels and lodging. Please feel free to reach out to either of us for advice on a place to stay or a certain neighborhood that you're looking at.


## What to do in Portland
July is one of the best times to visit Portland! You can expect average highs of 81 degrees and no precipitation, humidity or biting insect problems.

Craft beer and fine dining are serious business in Portland and we definitely suggest taking advantage of all the great places to eat and drink. We found a list of some popular places [here](http://pdx.eater.com/maps/best-portland-restaurants-38). There are so many wonderful places not on this list! [Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/portland) may be your friend to find a place near you.

One possible, but tiring, day's itinerary could be to start with an early breakfast at Gravy on N Mississippi or Tin Shed on NE Alberta. Post-breakfast, head downtown for walking along the Tom McCall's Waterfront Park, then shopping at Powell's books at NW 10th and Burnside and or ogling curated frills at the largest Anthropologie store in existence on NW Couch. Afterward, grab a slice of pizza across the street at Sizzle Pie on W Burnside or 3 blocks away from Wolf & Bear's foodcart on SW 10th. Or, forgo downtown's bustle and check out local wares and street food at the [Division/Clinton street fair](http://www.divisionclinton.com/the-division-clinton-street-fair/) (on July 22nd). Then head up the West Hills to the rose gardens and Japanese garden in Washington park. A late afternoon rest, then grab a happy hour cocktail and vegan bowl at Bye and Bye on NE Alberta, or go to the family friendly Hub Bikebar on NE Williams for draft beer and tavern-fare. Exhausted and stuffed, take refuge in the air conditioning of one of Portland's popular and affordable [second-run](http://www.laurelhursttheater.com/) or [non-profit](https://hollywoodtheatre.org/) movie theaters. At night (from July 21st to 23rd) see music at the **free**, all-ages music festival [PDX Pop Now!](http://pdxpopnow.com/)

## What to do outside of Portland
Columbia River Gorge: Less than an hour east of Portland, you can find the Columbia River Gorge. You'll find great views of Mount Hood and the Columbia River. There are hikes for all different ability levels, and vineyards and breweries too. The town of Hood River is fun to explore as well. 

Willamette Valley Wineries: About 45 minutes south of Portland is Willamette Valley's wine country. With dozens of wineries and beatiful vineyards, you can explore this area on your own in a car, stopping in at for some tastings along the way, or schedule a wine tour to get driven around to several vineyards. 

Oregon Coast: You can get to the coast in about 90 minutes from Portland. Cannon Beach and Seaside are two popular towns, although there are many more! 

## How to get here
Portland International Airport (PDX) is about 25 minutes from downtown Portland, and even closer to neighborhoods on the eastide of town. A taxi will take you to the city for about $25. Or, the light rail system can take you from the airport to downtown for only $2.50, but it will take about 45 minutes. 

## Getting around Portland
Portland's public transportation system, [Trimet](http://trimet.org), is fairly easy to navigate and will get you most places within the city. Their website has a trip planner feature. Taxis, Uber, and Lyft are also all over. Central Portland has a point to point [bike share system](https://www.biketownpdx.com/) for quick jaunts at a different pace than walking or driving. If you are wanting to venture outside of town, renting a car may be your most convenient option.
