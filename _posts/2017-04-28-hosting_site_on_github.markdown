Quick update: the website source is now on Github, where both Lisa and I can contribute to it. Lisa has been eagerly pushing commits to the master branch (with nary a commit message in sight). It is nice giving her some ownership over making changes to the site and demystifying some of the mechanics of how the site is generated!
